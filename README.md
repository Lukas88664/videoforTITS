experimental video
In this repo, we show the brief results of the experiments in the paper“A Bidirectional Prediction and Planning Coupling Method for Lane Change Trajectories”
Since the video containing full results of the simulation and the experiment is too large to store in GitHub, we have uploaded the video to Youtube  （https://youtu.be/vrL86OfmUzo）
